# The repository holds all my advanced programming course homeworks.

## The list of projects:
0. I really don't have any idea what was the context of this project.
1. A simple CLI diary application.
2. Four small questions to be solved using recursion and backtracking.
3. A CLI school weekly schedule calculator.
4. A salary manager CLI application.
5. THE BEST PROJECT OF THE COURSE. brand-new-turtix is an ordinary imitation of a 2D platform game.
6. A stupid clone of snap, again, CLI.
7. Just another failed imitation of FPL (Fantasy Premier League).
