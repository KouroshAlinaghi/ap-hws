# The repository holds all my advanced programming course homeworks.

## The list of projects:

* I really don't have any idea what was the context of this project.
* A simple CLI diary application.
* Four small questions to be solved using recursion and backtracking.
* A CLI school weekly schedule calculator.
* A salary manager CLI application.
* THE BEST PROJECT OF THE COURSE. brand-new-turtix is an ordinary imitation of a 2D platform game.
* A stupid clone of snap, again, CLI.
* Just another failed imitation of FPL (Fantasy Premier League).
