The repository holds all my advanced programming course homeworks.

## The list of projects:

* A1: A simple CLI diary application.
* A2: Four small questions to be solved using recursion and backtracking.
* A3: CLI school weekly schedule calculator.
* A4: salary manager CLI application.
* A5: THE BEST PROJECT OF THE COURSE. brand-new-turtix is an ordinary imitation of a 2D platform game.

* A7: Just another failed imitation of FPL (Fantasy Premier League).
* ABonus (A3.5): Refactoring a terrible source code.
